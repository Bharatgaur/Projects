            "Enter narration text for Slide 1:  Hello everyone! Welcome to this session on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. Today, we will dive into the fundamental concepts of OOP, why it is important, and how we can use it effectively in Python. Whether you are a beginner or someone looking to refine your knowledge, this session will help you get a clear understanding of OOP. So, let’s begin!\n",
            "Enter narration text for Slide 2: What is OOP? OOP is a programming paradigm based on objects, which contain data and methods.   Object-Oriented Programming, or OOP, is a programming approach that organizes code around objects and classes instead of just functions and logic. Each object represents a real-world entity, holding data (attributes) and performing actions (methods). For example, think about a Car. A car has properties like color, brand, and model, and it can perform actions like drive, brake, or accelerate. These properties and actions define an object. By using OOP, we make our programs more modular, reusable, and scalable, which makes coding efficient and organized.\n",
            "Enter narration text for Slide 3: Why Use OOP? OOP provides modularity, reusability, scalability, and maintainability.   Now, why should we use OOP? Modularity – It breaks large, complex problems into smaller parts, making the code easier to understand. Reusability – We can reuse code by creating classes and objects instead of writing the same logic again. Scalability – It is easier to add new features without affecting existing code. Maintainability – Debugging and updating code becomes simple. Real-world modeling – OOP closely represents how objects behave in real life. For example, in a large e-commerce application, every user can be an object, with attributes like name, email, and orders. Instead of writing code separately for each user, we define a class once and create multiple objects from it.\n",
            "Enter narration text for Slide 4: Core Concepts of OOP The key concepts of OOP are Class, Object, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.   OOP is built around six core concepts: Class – Think of it as a blueprint for creating objects. Object – An instance of a class that holds data and methods. Encapsulation – Hiding data to prevent direct access and making code more secure. Inheritance – Allowing one class to reuse properties and methods of another class. Polymorphism – The same function name can be used for different purposes. Abstraction – Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary information. These concepts make OOP powerful and flexible!\n",
            "Enter narration text for Slide 5: OOP in Python - Basic Syntax Example: Creating a simple Car class in Python.   Now, let’s look at a basic Python example that demonstrates OOP. class Car:     def  init (self, brand, color):         self.brand = brand  # Attribute         self.color = color  # Attribute          def drive(self):         print(fThe {self.color} {self.brand} is driving.)  # Method  # Creating an object my_car = Car(Tesla, Red) my_car.drive()  # Output: The Red Tesla is driving.  Here, ‘Car’ is a class, which acts as a blueprint. We define attributes (brand, color) and a method (drive). Then, we create an object ‘my_car’ with values (Tesla, Red). Calling the drive() method prints a message related to the object. This is how we create and use objects in Python!\n",
            "Enter narration text for Slide 6: Real-World Example OOP concepts in a Banking System.   Let’s take a real-world example of a Banking System. A BankAccount is a class that defines accounts. Every customer has an account object with attributes like account number and balance. Methods like deposit(), withdraw(), and check_balance() define actions users can take. Encapsulation keeps user data private. Inheritance allows creating specialized accounts, like SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount. Polymorphism lets different account types have different interest rates. This example shows how OOP makes software systems structured, secure, and easy to maintain.\n",
            "Enter narration text for Slide 7: Conclusion OOP enhances code structure and improves efficiency.   So, to wrap up, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) makes software development more structured, reusable, and scalable. Python’s OOP features allow us to build efficient applications, whether it's for web development, game development, or machine learning. To master OOP, start practicing by writing your own classes and objects. Try creating a Student Management System, a Library System, or a simple game using OOP principles. Thank you for your time, and I hope this session has given you a solid understanding of OOP in Python!\n",
